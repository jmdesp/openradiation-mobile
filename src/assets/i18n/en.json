We suggest that you create a user account at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openradiation.org/user/register\">www.openradiation.org</a>, and then configure this account in the application and activate automatic measurement publications (under the settings menu).",

    "MEASURES_HOW_TO": {
      "NOTICE": "Turn on your sensor, start the application, and connect the sensor via Bluetooth. OpenRadiation is a data base aiming to map environmental radioactivity. To ensure that the data received is homogeneous, comparable and as representative as possible, your measurements published on OpenRadiation must ideally be taken outdoors, if possible at a distance from housing, and with the sensor at a height of approximately 1 m above the ground. The longer the measurement, the more precise the measurement and hence the statistics: an indicator reflects the reliability of the measurement as you take it. After completing the measurement, you can qualify the local environment (indoors, in a plane, on a road, in a rural area, in town) and enter additional information before publishing the data. This information can be used to appraise the reliability of the measurement more precisely.",
